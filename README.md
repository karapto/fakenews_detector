# fakenews_detector

The spread of social networking services has made it possible for people to easily transmit and obtain information, and our lives have become more convenient. On the other hand, some of such information contains a picture of authenticity. News made with false information is called "fake news". The purpose of fake news is to deceive people and to earn advertising revenue by using shocking titles to gain viewership and to make unfounded slander of a specific person or group. In recent years, various problems have arisen due to this fake news. Case in point: on December 4, 2016, a gunman broke into a restaurant to verify the truth of the fake news about candidate Clinton's conspiracy theory that was spread on SNS during the US presidential election[1].

It takes time to manually determine whether a piece of news is fake news or not, as it has to be scrutinized for falsehoods. In addition, the diversification of the media has produced a large amount of news. Therefore, it is very difficult to detect all fake news manually. Therefore, there is a growing need for research on automatic detection of fake news[2].
